# VTT to Plain Text Converter

A simple script to convert `.vtt` subtitle files into plain text by removing timestamps, numbering, and metadata.

---

## How to Use

1. Update the file paths in the script:
   ```python
   vtt_file = 'path_to_your_file.vtt'  # Input VTT file
   output_file = 'path_to_output_file.txt'  # Output text file
   ```
2. Run the script:
   ```python
   vtt_to_text.py
   ```
3. The plain text will be saved in the specified output file.


## Example

**Input (`42.vtt`):**

```csharp
WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
This is an example subtitle.

2
00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:04.000
Here is another line.
```

**Output (output42.txt):**

```csharp
This is an example subtitle. Here is another line.

This will render the "Input" and "Output" sections in the same styled way, including the "Copy code" button when hosted on GitHub or similar platforms. Let me know if you need further adjustments! ðŸ˜Š
